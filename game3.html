            that you would really like to attend. You only have enough money for one of these. Which will you pick?</h3>

            continue in your studies. You are unable to participate in the class trip and are disappointed when your friends
            talk about how great it was.<br><br>Many children miss out on trips due to income. A lot of schools offer financial aid to those
            who request, however the United Kingdom’s Children’s Commission on Poverty found that 55% of students felt embarrassed about
            their income, and would self-exclude themselves from activities instead of asking for help.">Notebook</button>

            According to the National Center for Children in Povery, one in five children who live below the poverty line struggle
            to purchase basic school supplies. For most families, having pencils and paper is a given, but it is a real struggle for others."

            <h3>Your parents have been away all night, leaving you to take care of your siblings. After a long night of making dinner, helping with
            homework, and putting them to bed, finally you are done and have time to yourself. By this time however, it is already very late. Should
            you work on homework or go to bed?</h3>
            <button type="button" class="choice btn btn-info btn-lg" id="choice" data-id="You decide to do your homework. With being busy every night
            you know how easy it is to fall behind, and know taking one night off will lead to trouble down the road. You then get less sleep
            than you should and your focus at school suffers.<br><br> The National Health Society released a list of dangers that come from lack of
            sleep. While in the short term acedemic performace can be hindered by lack of focus, a reduced ability to retain information, and
            drowsyness, there are long term effects as well from prolonged sleep deprivation. This includes increased risks for heart disease,
            diabetes, obesity, mental health conditions, and more.

            Statistically, students from low income and underprivileged families get less
            sleep. Not only are the hours reduced, but the quality as well. A study by the American Academy of Neurology reveals that those in low
            income families are 25% more likely to have sleep disorders, leading to even more issues revolving around sleep."

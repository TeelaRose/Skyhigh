            <h3>You now must travel to school. You have the option of 2 routes: a shorter route that you know you will make it on time
            to school by following but a group of other students who often bully you frequent this path, or a longer path that is safe,
            but you may not make it on time to school by following. Which will you pick?</h3>
            <button type="button" class="choice btn btn-info btn-lg" id="choice" data-id="You decide to pick the shorter path.
            Unfortunately, you run into this malicious group of students. <br><br>According to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics,
            two in five children from low income families experience bullying. In addition, the National Childrenâ€™s Bureau found
            only 58% of students in poverty talked to parents about important issues, compared to 67% of other students. This
            means they are not only bullied more, but have less people to reach out to for help.">Short path</button>
            <button type="button" class="choice btn btn-info btn-lg" id="choice2" data-id="You decide to take the longer path to
            avoid being bullied, however you do not make it to school on time and as a result, miss some of the information taught in class.
            This leads to an overall lower mark, as you repeadetly miss part of class from taking a long route. <br><br>
            The National Assessment of Educational Progress did a study in 2015 which shows most students who missed 3 days in a month of school were
            were diagnosed with a disability, students who were eligible for free lunch, Hispanic English language learners,
            and Native American students, all of which are underprivileged groups.">Long path</button>

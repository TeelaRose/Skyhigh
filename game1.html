            <h3>You wake up one morning and remember you have an assignment due first period. You have no printer at home,
            and would need to print it off at school before class. Looking at the time, you realize you have time to either go
            to school and print off the assignment, or eat breakfast. What will you do? </h3>
            <button type="button" class="choice btn btn-info btn-lg" id="choice" data-id="You decide to eat breakfast. You feel full
            and ready for the day, but you unfortunately recieve a zero on the assignment, despite having it completed.<br><br>
            Technology access is a large barrier for many students. According to a study done by the University of Southern California,
            only about 85% of students between kindegarten and grade 12 have access to internet. The student in this story was
            more fortunate as they were only lacking a printer, and could have printed at school. Many students struggle in their
            studies because working at home is a large barrier due to lack of technology.">Eat breakfast</button>
            <button type="button" class="choice btn btn-info btn-lg" id="choice2" data-id="You print off the assignment and hand it
            in on time. Unfortunately, since you did not eat, you are not able to focus properly and perform poorly on a test you had.
            <br><br>The No Kid Hungry campaign estimates there are about 3 million kids who go to school without breakfast.
            In fact, the character in this story is more fortunate than others,
            as they were given the option of food whereas many students are not.">Print the assignment</button>

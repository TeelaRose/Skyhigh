            <h3>The bell rings for lunch. You have no money to buy food and did not have food at home to bring, so you plan on not eating.
            You hear your friends talking about buying food from the cafeteria, and they invite you to come. Will you tell them you have no money
            for food and sit with them, or lie about needing to study to avoid telling them?</h3>

            <br><br>Low income students are often too embarrassed about their financial state to tell others. The United Kingdom’s Children’s Commission
            on Poverty found that 55% of students from low income families were too embarrassed to tell others and would avoid activities that related
            to money.">Stay with friends</button>

            weaker and weaker as you often opt out of activities because you do not want to share your financial state with others.<br><br>
            A research study done by Simon Hjalmarsson and Carina Mood reveals that underprivileged students have fewer friends because of lack of
            participation, shame, stigmatism, and status mechanisms. Simple activities like making friends is made significantly harder for
            underprivileged students."

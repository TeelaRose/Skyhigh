            <h3>The school day is now over. An extra-curricular you were very excited for is to take place, but you should go home to watch your
            younger siblings since your parents are at work. Will you stay at school for your extracurricular knowing your siblings will be alone
            and without dinner, or walk your siblings home and watch them?</h3>

            You find it difficult to enjoy your time however, since you spend the entire time wondering if your siblings made it home on time and
            feel guilty that they have not been fed.

            A correlation between those who need to take care of their siblings and low acedmic asperations in a study done by Hisp J Behav. This is
            because the students had less time to spend studying, and showed up late for class often because they needed to take their younger
            siblings to class before attending their own, leading to lower acedmic achievement."

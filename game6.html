            <h3>At home, you have a big project due the next day but your family is extremely loud, and thereâ€™s not much space, resulting in a
            distracting working environment. You can either go to the library, or stay at home.</h3>
            <button type="button" class="choice btn btn-info btn-lg" id="choice" data-id="You decide to go to the library to work. Due to
            circumstances, it is unlikely that you will be able to get a ride, so must walk or ride a bike. <br><br>If you are lucky, the library is nearby,
            however it could take a very long time to get there. If a library is within about 3 kilometers you could make it in half an hour. With
            needing to go there and back, plus there and back again for dinner, this can take 2 hours out of your day.
            ">Go to the library</button>
            <button type="button" class="choice btn btn-info btn-lg" id="choice2" data-id="Despite all the distractions, you decide it will be
            easier to stay at home. This makes it more difficult to focus, leading to frustration, and your work taking longer than it should to
            complete, and results in lower quality work.<br><br>
            This again results in lower acedmic standards from low income families. Students face many difficulties in these circumstaces, making
            it very difficult to perfrom well in school and pursue higher education. This is the 'poverty cycle' as due to low income, these students
            will not be able to get a good education and good job, and will end up having low income later in life. This is a cycle since the deeper
            in poverty you are, the deeper you will sink in it."

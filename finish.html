        <h1>Thank you for playing!</h1>
        <h3>Hopefully this gave you an insight to what some students face on a daily basis!</h3>
        <p>In this game, there never seemed to be a 'right answer'. Each path had its own disadvantages, completely out of the your
        control. This is what life can be like for underprivileged families, especially those with low-income. Although life is not always
        this extreme for all families, it is like this for some.</p><br>
        <p>Being underprivileged or in poverty can be hard to detect. Especially when playing through the game, there were multiple
        instances that went over the embarrassment people feel revealing their state of income. Despite struggling so much, it is
        difficult for these people to reach out and ask for help. </p><br>
        <p>It therefore, is important for those with privilege to be mindful. If some friends seem reluctant to participate in
        activities that cost money, try and limit the number of these activities and instead incorporate free and lost cost events. If a friend
        always seems to be at work or taking care of siblings, it may be because they do not have a choice. Make an effort to connect with them
        in other ways if possible.</p>
        <p>There are endless ways to be mindful of your peers and friends who are underprivileged. It is something all people should try to be
        mindful of and understand.</p>

            <h3>Money is running very tight in your family. Already, you are finding it difficult to manage your responsabilities, but you know
            as money tightens, it will only get harder. Will you find a part time job to help your family financially, or stay as you are?</h3>
            <button type="button" class="choice btn btn-info btn-lg" id="choice" data-id="You have decided to find a part time job. Despite being
            very busy and struggling in your studies already, you would like to help out your family. Your marks drop even further with less and
            less time to dedicate to your studies. <br><br>
            Dropping marks is a recurrent theme throughout the lives of underprivileged students. According to the National Center for Education Stats,
            27% of highschool dropouts left school because they were failing too many classes. With marks lowering, dropping out can become a serious
            risk for underprivileged students. Another high contributing factor is leaving school to become caregivers, which accounted for about
            26%. This again is dangerous, because if students themselves don't get a job, but their parents start working more hours leaving older
            siblings to care for the younger, they may drop out of school.
            ">Do homework</button>
            <button type="button" class="choice btn btn-info btn-lg" id="choice2" data-id="You decide not to find work. Balancing school and home life
            is already hard enough, adding a job on top of that would be near impossible. The problems you face gradually increase as your income
            lowers, making life harder on the whole family.<br><br>
            Nearly 20% of high school students in low income families not on welfare worked over 20 hours a week, according to the Urban Institute
            National Survey of American Families. Not only would accepting a job take
            some time away, but to gain enough money to make a large difference, these students work very long hours. If grades already were dropping,
            this would cause a drastic decrease on top of that."
